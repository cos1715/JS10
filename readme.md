# JS Homework

Feel free to modify test data or add new data
It will help for better testing

## Server Mock

Create class **UserService**  
Implement every scenario from [dummy users BE](https://dummyjson.com/docs/users) in your class  
For each scenario create new method  
Methods can be static  
Read response from BE and console.log it or store it in class properties  
Don't forget to catch errors when request failed

\*Extra task: Delete users with ids 1,2,3,4 and random id from 5 to 10000 simultaneously  
Use Promise.allSettled for this task

```javascript
class UserService {
  // your code
}
```
